# localtls

This is a simple DNS server in Python3 to provide TLS to webservices on local addresses. In short, it resolves addresses such as `192-168-0-1.yourdomain.net` to `192.168.0.1` and has a valid TLS certificate for them.

This was written to circumvent the problem that current browsers require a secure context for a number of operations, such as opening the camera with `getUserMedia`, but the web service is running on a local network, where it is difficult to get a certificate or handling the local DNS servers is difficult or impossible (aham users aham). It can also be used to easily develop and debug web applications that require secure contexts other than in localhost.

Technically it's a very simple DNS server written in Python, which uses [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to generate a wildcard certificate for *.yourdomain.net on a real public server. This certificate, both private and public keys, is available for download via both a  `REST` call as well as two `GET` calls on a simple HTTP server, also provided.

## Technical explanation and motivation

Browsers require <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/">a secure context</a> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">MDN</a>) for several Web APIs to work. While this is simple for public websites, it is a difficult issue for intranets and private IPs. When you're deploying applications on networks that you have no control, it's a nightmare.

This software provides:

1. DNS server:  resolves to IP.yourdomain.net (for local IPs, see below) to IP. Run on the public internet.
2. HTTP server: show an `index.html` as well as REST endpoint public and private keys
3. Certbot one-liner: renews certificate with LetsEncrypt via DNS authentication. Run once a month.

## What this DNS resolves

* `yourdomain.net` : to your server IP for both `A` and `AAAA` (if it exists) records.
* `_acme-challenge.yourdomain.net` : necessary for the certbot authentication during renewal
* `a-b-c-d.yourdomain.net`:  resolves to `A` record to `a.b.c.d`. (replace `.` by `-`).
* `fe80-[xxx].yourdomain.net`: resolves to `AAAA` record to `fe80:[xxx]` (replace any `:` by `-`).
* `anything else`: falls back to `dns-fallback` as defined in config

## Security considerations

"But if you provide the public and the private key, someone can do a man-in-the-middle attack!" Yes, that is correct. This is *as safe as a plain HTTP website if you release the private key*. 

This service here aims to solve the *requirement of browsers with secure contexts in LANs with a minimum fuss*: when you are developing an app that requires TLS, for example, and want to test it on several devices locally. Or when you want to deploy a web application on customer networks that have no expertise. Hopefully browsers will come up with a solution that makes secure contexts in intranets easier in the future, but it has been a problem for years and it's still unsolved at this time.

In short, you have two possible scenarios. The first: you understand that by using this you may be prone for a MITM attack, but you need a secure context in the browser no matter what, and you do need absolute certainty that your traffic will not be snooped or your application won't be spoofed. This works for most webservices running in a LAN, and is as safe as running them on pure HTTP.

The second: you need not only a secure context for the browser, but actual safety of a private TLS certificate validated by the browser. In this case you can run the DNS server yourself and not publish the private keys, but find someway to distribute them yourself privately to your application. Remember, any application you deploy using TLS will require a private key deployed with it. When distributing web apps that are supposed to run in intranets which you have no access this is hard to do; you'd ideally need to generate a different key for every host, even though they may use the same private IP, you have no access to a local nameserver and other complications. There is a [nice proposal of how this can be done](https://blog.heckel.io/2018/08/05/issuing-lets-encrypt-certificates-for-65000-internal-servers/) if you need this level of security.

# How to Run

## Overview

1. Get an Ubuntu server. It doesn't need to be big. Ideally you should have at least one slave, too, because NS entries require at least two servers.
2. Point the NS entry of your domain to this server.
3. [Install deps](#base-installation-and-deps).
4. [Run dnsserver.py](#running-the-dns-server).
5. [Create the certificates running certbotdns.py](#renewing-keys).

## Base installation and deps

You essentially need Python 3.6 or above, certbot and the dnslib and cherrypy PIPs.

We provide a simple `util/ubuntu-install.bash` script that installs all you need to be able to run this software on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 installation.

## Running the DNS server

This software uses port 6000 for internal communication. It is bound to 127.0.0.1 and is secured by the password `secret`.  This is just to pass the validation code from certbot to the DNS Server to the Web Server.

### Manually 

Start the DNS Server to test and figure the correct values like this:

`python3 dnsserver.py --domain yourdomain.net --soa-master=ns1.yourdomain.net --soa-email=email@yourdomain.net --ns-servers=ns1.yourdomain.net,ns2.yourdomain.net --log-level DEBUG --http-port 80 --http-index /somewhere/index.html` 

Run `python3 dnsserver.py --help` for a list of arguments:

* `--domain`: REQUIRED. Your domain or subdomain.
* `--soa-master`: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. Primary master name server for SOA record. You should fill this to be compliant to RFC 1035. 
* `--soa-email`: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. Email address for administrator for SOA record. You should fill this to be compliant to RFC 1035.
* `--ns-servers`: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. The list of nameservers, separated by commas, for the NS record.
* `--dns-port`: DNS server port. Defaults to 53. You need to be root on linux to run this on a port < 1024.
* `--dns-fallback`: The DNS fallback server. This server can be used as full DNS resolver in your network, falling back to this server.  Defaults to the `1.1.1.1`.
* `--domain-ipv4`: The ipv4 for the naked domain. Defaults to the server IPV4. 
* `--domain-ipv6`: The ipv6 for the naked domain. Defaults to the server IPV6, if present.
* `--http-port`: the HTTP server port. If not set, no HTTP server is started. The HTTP server is used to serve a index.html for the `/` location and the `/keys` with the keys.
* `--http-index-file`: path to the HTTP index html. We don't serve assets. The file is read upon start and cached. 
* `--log-level`: INFO|WARNING|ERROR|DEBUG. You should run on ERROR level in production.
* `--only-private-ips`: Only resolve private ips.
* `--no-reserved-ips`: Don't resolve reserved ips.

Create the wildcard domain:

`python3 certbotdns.py wildcard yourdomain.net email@yourdomain.net`

Create the naked domain:

`python3 certbotdns.py naked yourdomain.net email@yourdomain.net`

### Automated

Once you have manually tested and figured out how to run your server, use this technique to automate it:

1. Ensure your `localtls` directory is `/root/localtls` and `cd` into it
2. Create your own service script: `cp service.example.sh service.sh`
3. Put the one-liner from [above in "Manually"](#manually) into the newly created `service.sh` file
4. Copy the `systemd` file into place, reload `systemd`, start and enable it:
   ```commandline
   sudo cp localtls.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable localtls
   sudo systemctl start localtls
   ```
5. Add a cron to ensure the certs are renewed once a month:

    ```
    0 0 1 * * /usr/bin/python3 /root/localtls/certbotdns.py wildcard yourdomain.net email@yourdomain.net; /usr/bin/python3 /root/localtls/certbotdns.py naked yourdomain.net email@yourdomain.net
    ```

## Slave DNS server

To run a secondary NS server, we suggest run dnsserver.py without a HTTP server. Remember to set `--domain-ipv4` and `--domain-ipv6` pointing to the master server. Do not run certbotdns.py on the slave servers. 

### Testing

Run locally like this for a minimal test at port 5300:

`python3 dnsserver.py --domain=yourdomain.net --dns-port=5300`

Run dig to test:

`dig @localhost -p 5300 +nocmd 192-168-0-255.yourdomain.net ANY +multiline +noall +answer`

# Using this in your webservice

We at [Corollarium](https://corollarium.com) are using it at [videowall.online](https://videowall.online). It's used in our [video wall](https://softwarevideowall.com).

You should fetch the keys remotely before you open your webservice. Keys are valid for three months, but renewed every month. If your service runs continuously for longer than that you should either restart the service or make it poll and replace the keys every 24h or so.

First, make sure you run with `--http-port`. Make a REST GET rest for `[DOMAIN]/keys` and you'll get a JSON with the following keys:

* privkey: the private key.
* cert: the public certificate.
* chain: the chain certificate.
* fullchain: the full chain certificate.

This follows the same pattern of files created by Let's Encrypt.

## Node.js code

This code will try to get the keys until a timeout and open a HTTPS server using those keys locally. Remember to replace `yourdomain.net`.

```
function localtls(dnsserver) {
	const request = require('request');
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
		request({
			uri: dnsserver + '/keys',
			timeout: 10000,
		}, function (error, response, body) {
			if (error) {
				reject(error);
			}
			else {
				try {
					let d = JSON.parse(body);
					resolve({key: d.privkey, cert: d.cert, ca: d.chain});
				}
				catch (e) {
					reject(e);
				}
			}
		});
	});
}

var app = express(), https;
try {
	let keys = await localtls('http://yourdomain.net');

	// reload keys every week, see https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/15115
	let ctx = tls.createSecureContext(keys);
	setInterval(() => {
		lantls().then((k) => { keys = k; }).catch(e => {});
	}, 7*24*60*60*1000);

	https = require('https').createServer({
		SNICallback: (servername, cb) => {
			cb(null, ctx);
		}
	}, app);
}
catch(e) {
	// pass
	console.log("invalid https", e);
}
```
